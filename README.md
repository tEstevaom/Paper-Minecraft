02 Dec 2014 - Scratch Team silently placed a limit on the notes and credits section so I've removed my change log :(.

01 Dec 2014 - v10.0 - We made it! Made it to version 10 woop! After all that work I am feeling strangely hungry?

The mechanics of hunger --> ★ Steve has 20 hunger points (displayed as 10 chops), ★ Steve has 80 food saturation points (which are not displayed), ★ As you walk, jump and mine, your food saturation points are reduced, ★ Once the saturation drops to 0, you begin to lose hunger points, ★ Eating food increases both the food saturation points and the hunger bar together, ★ The outcome of this? - Eat 3 healthy meals a day *grin* - snacking food will cause you to be hungry again much sooner! ★ Health now only regenerated when you have 18 or more hunger points, ★ Health depletes when you have 0 hunger points.

All the graphics are taken from the Minecraft wiki page and have not been created by me. I have rescaled them and broken them up to make the game work, but that is it at present.
